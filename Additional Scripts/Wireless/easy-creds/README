1. Prereqs:

* screen
* freeradius-wpe
* hamster
* ferret
* sslstrip
* dsniff
* urlsnarf
* metasploit
* airbase-ng
* airodump-ng
* hostapd
* mdk3
* ipcalc
* asleap


2. Installations:

Run the installer, it *should* install everything you need. If not, you'll need to do it manually

Most can be installed from repos, I've included some instruction on installing from source.

###
aircrack-ng suite

This is already installed by default, however, there are know issues for airbase-ng with the base v1.1 distro install. It is recommended that you grab the latest nightly build from the SVN repo and recompile

        svn co http://trac.aircrack-ng.org/svn/trunk/ /tmp/aircrack-ng
        cd /tmp/aircrack-ng/
        make && make install
        bash /usr/local/sbin/airodump-ng-oui-update

###
freeradius-wpe

The free radius in the repo does not include the wpe patch. It is best to install from source

	wget ftp://ftp.freeradius.org/pub/radius/old/freeradius-server-2.1.11.tar.bz2 -O /tmp/freeradius-server-2.1.11.tar.bz2
	wget http://www.opensecurityresearch.com/files/freeradius-wpe-2.1.11.patch -O /tmp/freeradius-wpe-2.1.11.patch
	cd /tmp
	tar -jxvf freeradius-server-2.1.11.tar.bz2
	mv freeradius-wpe-2.1.11.patch /tmp/freeradius-server-2.1.11/freeradius-wpe-2.1.11.patch
	cd freeradius-server-2.1.11
	patch -p1 < freeradius-wpe-2.1.11.patch
	./configure && make && make install
	cd /usr/local/etc/raddb/certs/
	./bootstrap

###
Hamster & Ferret

	mkdir /opt/sidejack
	cd /tmp
	wget http://www.erratasec.com/erratasec.zip -O /tmp/erratasec.zip
	unzip erratasec.zip
	cd hamster/build/gcc4/
	make
	cp /tmp/ec-install/hamster/bin/* /opt/sidejack
	rm -rf /tmp/ferret

	svn checkout http://ferret.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ /tmp/ferret
	cd /tmp/ferret/
	make
	cp /tmp/ferret/bin/ferret /opt/sidejack/ferret

###
asleap

	mkdir /opt/asleap
	wget http://www.willhackforsushi.com/code/asleap/2.2/asleap-2.2.tgz -O /tmp/asleap.tgz
	cd /tmp
	tar xvf asleap.tgz
	cd asleap
	make
	mv /tmp/asleap/* /opt/asleap/

###
MDK3

	wget http://homepages.tu-darmstadt.de/~p_larbig/wlan/mdk3-v6.tar.bz2 -O /tmp/mdk3-v6.tar.bz2
	cd /tmp
	tar -xvjpf mdk3-v6.tar.bz2
	cd mdk3-v6
	make && make install

3. Configuration of Program paths
One of the things I tried to do with this version is to remove the hardcoded paths relating to BackTrack. This is an attempt to use easy-creds on other distros (Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat)

In order to pull this off I was originally using the 'locate' command to identify the proper exec paths. This proved to be a bit clugy, so I decided to use variable declarations for the paths. This is much easier, but requires some additional set up by the user.

The current paths are set with the defaults used by the installer but easily changeable. Starting on line 118 you can set the proper paths, using 'locate' or 'which'

example:
root@bt:~# which mdk3
/usr/local/sbin/mdk3

Based on the info you would set the following:
mdk3path="/usr/local/sbin"


4. Working with easy-creds within a screen

I don't want to assume everyone is perfectly comfortable with screen, but please read some tutorials from the web. When using the pwnie you will most likely be in a screen session already, if not make sure that's the first thing you do once you get your shell.

easy-creds will look for X windows running, but shouldn't find it on the pwnie and launch everything in a screen sessions. This can feel a bit like Inception once you're in a screen within a screen

The main thing to remember is once the easy-creds screen session launches you should do the following from command prompt.

screen -list (you should see the easy-creds session)
screen -r easy-creds

You are now interacting with the easy-creds screen session. Normally to view your screens you would press ctrl-a then " and this will show you what screens you have open in the session.

Where it gets tricky is when you have a screen session, then launch another screen session (easy-creds attacks). When that happens you will need to do the following:

ctrl-a then a then "

That extra 'a' lets the screen program know you want to work with the inner screen session.

Yes it is confusing a bit at first but you'll get the hang of it.

Even if the version is not the same, the base functionality is.

Happy hunting!!
